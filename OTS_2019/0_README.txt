Open Tax Solver - Package
--------------------------

July 2, 2020 v17.08 - For 2019 tax-year.

See project homepage:	http://opentaxsolver.sourceforge.net/

OpenTaxSolver (OTS) is a set of programs and templates for helping you
fill out your income tax forms.  It performs the tedious arithmetic.
OTS is intended to assist those who normally prepare their tax forms
themselves, and who generally know on which lines to enter their numbers.
It is meant to be used in combination with the instruction booklet 
corresponding to a given form.

This package contains programs and templates for:
	- US-1040 - which also does the Schedules A, B, D, and forms 8949. 
	- Schedule C for US-1040.
	- State Income Taxes for California, Ohio, New Jersey, 
	  Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and North Carolina.
	  All updated for 2019 Tax-Year.
Also contains an Automatic PDF Form-Fillout function:
	- Supports all Federal Forms and State Forms.
	  Saves time by filling out many of the numbers.  
	  You may still need to enter some information or check boxes
	  that are not handled by OTS.
	  Tested to work properly with many viewers.
	- You can edit your forms with Libre-Office.

  (Located in the top directory.)
 RPLCSTRNG_04
 For Auto-Fillout of PDF Forms, click the "Print" button, and select
  "Automatically Fill-out PDF Tax-Form", then click "Print".
 You can set your preferred PDF viewer by the (Set PDF Viewer) button,
  or by setting the environment variable:  PDF_VIEWER
 The Auto-Fillout feature is tested to work properly with the PDF
 viewers "Google-Chrome", "Firefox", "LibreOffice", "Atril", "Xpdf", 
 "Safari", "IE", "Edge", and "Acrobat Reader".
 You can edit your filled-out PDF forms with LibreOffice.

General:
Example tax-data files and blank starting templates are included under
the "tax_form_files" directory.  For each filer, save filled-out 
template to a new name, such as "fed1040_2019.txt".  After filling-in the
lines, then run the tax solver on it.  From the GUI, this is done by
pressing "Compute Tax" button.
Or solvers can be run from the command-line, for example, as:
  bin/taxsolve_usfed1040_2019  Fed1040_2019.txt
Where "Fed1040_2019.txt" is the name of -your- tax-data file, which
you can edit with your favorite text-editor to fill it in or print
it out.  Output results are saved to "..._out.txt" files
(eg. Fed1040_2019_out.txt), and can be printed out directly too.
