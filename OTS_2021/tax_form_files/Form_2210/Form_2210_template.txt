{ The following four fields are for entry of the tax due on the annualized
 income extrapolated from the income and deductions during the respective
 period.  If you are able to use the tax tables or tax rate schedules, make
 no entries in these fields, and the program will calculate the tax. This
 will simplify your calculations; however, you may pay more estimated tax
 than necessary.}  

{ If you have tax preference items, such as capital gains and/or qualified
 dividends, you can reduce your estimated tax by using the Qualified
 Dividends and Capital Gains Tax Worksheet or other appropriate worksheet to
 calculate the annualized tax due each period.  To do this, multiply each
 item of income and each deduction that varies by period by the
 annualization factor for that period to estimate your taxable income for
 the year.}

{ Period 1:      4
 Period 2:      2.4
 Period 3;      1.5
 Period 4:      1 } 

{ You may also have, and/or be eligible for, certain credits---some of
 which may be based upon your estimated taxable income for the year.  You
 may be able to reduce one or more of your estimated tax payments by
 including these credits in your tax calculation.  You can use the 2021
 estimated tax version of OTS to calculate the tax due on your estimated
 income for the year that was extrapolated from the information for the
 relevant period.    See instructions for form 2210 and IRS publication 505.
