[L30] Recovery Rebate Credit

The recovery rebate credit was paid out
to eligible individuals in two rounds of
advance payments called economic im-
pact payments. The economic impact
payments were based on your 2018 or
2020 tax year information. The recovery
rebate credit is figured like the economic
impact payments except that the credit
eligibility and the credit amount are
based on your 2020 tax year informa-
tion. If you didn't receive the full
amount of the recovery rebate credit as
economic impact payments, you may be
able to claim the recovery rebate credit
on your 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

Generally, you are eligible to claim
the recovery rebate credit if in 2020 you
were a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident ali-
en, weren't a dependent of another tax-
payer, and have a valid social security
number. This includes someone who
died in 2020, if you are preparing a re-
turn for that person. Use the Recovery
Rebate Credit Worksheet to figure the
credit, if any, you can claim. For more
information on the recovery rebate cred-
it, go to IRS.gov/RRC.

[L38] Estimated Tax Penalty

You may owe this penalty if:
 - Line 37 is at least $1,000 and it is
more than 10% of the tax shown on your
return, or
 - You didn't pay enough estimated
tax by any of the due dates. This is true
even if you are due a refund.
For most people, the "tax shown on
your return" is the amount on your 2020
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24, minus
the total of any amounts shown on lines
27, 28, 29, and 30; Schedule 3, lines 8
and 11; and Forms 7202 (lines 24 and
35), 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III through
IX only), 8885, and 8919. 

Exception: You won't owe the penalty
if your 2020 tax return was for a tax
year of 12 full months and either of the
following applies.
 1. You had no tax shown on your
  2020 return and you were a U.S. citizen
  or resident for all of 2020.
 2. The total of lines 25d, 26, and
  Schedule 3, line 10, on your 2020 return
  is at least 100% of the tax shown on
  your 2020 return (110% of that amount
  if you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and
  your adjusted gross income (AGI)
  shown on your 2020 return was more
  than $150,000 (more than $75,000 if
  married filing separately for 2020)).
  Your estimated tax payments for 2020
  must have been made on time and for
  the required amount.

figure your deduction.
Exception. You don't have to file Form
4952 if all three of the following apply.

is less than your investment income
from interest and ordinary dividends mi-
nus any qualified dividends.

whale hunting activities. See Pub. 526

ganization should be able to provide you
with verification of its charitable status.

IRS.gov/TEOS to see if an organization
is eligible to receive tax-deductible con-
tributions (Publication 78 data).

[A18] Elect to Itemize Check-Box

Normally leave this as "No".

Only select "Y" if you want to force itemzation
even when it will be less than your standard deduction.
There are certain rare situations when this is beneficial
due to state taxes, etc.
