[L91] Use Tax.

You are required to enter a number on this line. If the amount due is
zero, you must check the applicable box to indicate that you either owe
no use tax, or you paid your use tax obligation directly to the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration.

You may owe use tax if you make purchases from out-of-state retailers
(for example, purchases made by telephone, online, by mail, or in
person) where California sales or use tax was not paid and you use
those items in California.

[L112] Interest and Penalties

Interest. Interest will be charged on any late filing or late payment
penalty from the original due date of the return to the date paid. In
addition, if other penalties are not paid within 15 days, interest will be
charged from the date of the billing notice until the date of payment.
Interest compounds daily and the interest rate is adjusted twice a year.
The FTB website has a chart of interest rates in effect since 1976. Go to
ftb.ca.gov and search for interest rates.

Late Filing of Tax Return. If you do not file your tax return by
October 15, 2020, you will incur a late filing penalty plus interest from
the original due date of the tax return. The maximum total penalty is
25% of the tax not paid if the tax return is filed after October 15, 2020.
The minimum penalty for filing a tax return more than 60 days late is
$135 or 100% of the balance due, whichever is less.

Late Payment of Tax. If you fail to pay your total tax liability by
April 15, 2020, you will incur a late payment penalty plus interest. The
penalty is 5% of the tax not paid when due plus 1/2% for each month, or
part of a month, the tax remains unpaid. We may waive the late payment
penalty based on reasonable cause. Reasonable cause is presumed
when 90% of the tax shown on the return is paid by the original due
date of the return. However, the imposition of interest is mandatory. If,
after April 15, 2020, you find that your estimate of tax due was too low,
pay the additional tax as soon as possible to avoid or minimize further
accumulation of penalties and interest.

Late Payment of Use Tax. To avoid late payment penalties for use
tax, you must report and pay the use tax with a timely filed income tax
return, or California Individual Use Tax return.
Other Penalties. We may impose other penalties if a payment is
returned for insufficient funds. We may also impose penalties for
negligence, substantial understatement of tax, and fraud.

[L113] Underpayment of Estimated Tax

You may be subject to an estimated tax penalty if any of the following is true:

# # Your withholding and credits are less than 90% of your current tax
    year liability.

# # Your withholding and credits are less than 100% of your prior
    year tax liability (110% if AGI is more than $150,000 or $75,000 if
    married/RDP filing separately).

# # You did not pay enough through withholding to keep the amount
    you owe with your tax return under $500 ($250 if married/RDP filing
    separately).

# # You did not make the required estimate payments, if you pay an
    installment after the date it is due, or if you underpay any installment,
    a penalty may be assessed on the portion of estimated tax that was
    underpaid from the due date of the installment to the date of payment
    or the due date of your return, whichever is earlier. Get the 2019
    form FTB 5805, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals and
    Fiduciaries, for more information.

send you a bill.
